CrypTool (CT) is an open-source project focused on cryptography and cryptanalysis education. It provides interactive tools and learning materials to help users understand cryptographic algorithms, techniques, and security concepts. The project includes multiple software versions:

    CrypTool 1 (CT1) – A Windows application offering a classic interface for learning cryptographic methods.
    CrypTool 2 (CT2) – A more modern, modular Windows application with visual programming capabilities.
    JCrypTool (JCT) – A Java-based version for cross-platform compatibility.
    CrypTool Online (CTO) – A web-based version for quick access without installation.

CrypTool is widely used in education and research to analyze encryption techniques, perform attacks, and understand security principles. It supports both classical ciphers (e.g., Caesar, Vigenère) and modern cryptographic algorithms (e.g., AES, RSA, ECC).
