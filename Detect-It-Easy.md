Detect It Easy (DIE) is a powerful and user-friendly tool designed for analyzing and identifying the characteristics of executable files. It is commonly used by reverse engineers and malware analysts to determine the type of packer, compiler, or protector used in a given executable. DIE supports a wide range of file formats and provides detailed information about the file's structure, making it easier to understand and analyze.

### Key Features:
- **File Analysis**: Detects the type of packer, compiler, or protector used in executable files.
- **Wide Format Support**: Supports various file formats including PE, ELF, and Mach-O.
- **Detailed Information**: Provides comprehensive details about the file's structure and characteristics.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface suitable for both beginners and advanced users.
- **Plugin Support**: Extendable through plugins to add additional functionality and support for more file types.
- **Entropy Analysis**: Analyzes the entropy of files to detect packed or encrypted data.

Detect It Easy is an essential tool for anyone involved in revers

## Entropy
PhoneSploit. There was a question in which I had to use PhoneSploit to get some files. I first checked for ADB port on all IP addresses and I found 1 IP in which ADB was open. I then used PhoneSploit to access the elf files. After that, I used DIE to scan the files. The question asked to find files whose entropy value was high.
