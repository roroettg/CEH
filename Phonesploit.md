# MÃ¶gliche Aufgabe
PhoneSploit. There was a question in which I had to use PhoneSploit to get some files. I first checked for ADB port on all IP addresses and I found 1 IP in which ADB was open. I then used PhoneSploit to access the elf files. After that, I used DIE to scan the files. The question asked to find files whose entropy value was high.
